This webserver work with `express` and `socket.io`, you have example routes and socket messages, also a public directory for the frontend css ressources like js and css file

## Can i take it ?

YES ! It's for you, i know it's not the best you can find but the easiest.
just one thing important : if you're making a public website, place a link of this repo or my website somewhere, like in footer or a credit page
